I'll present some Machine Learning (ML) and statistical inference ideas that I've found useful in my work.  My most recent project is to build and implement  machine learning based Causal Inference models that can aid air traffic managers to make better decisions given large datasets of observed and forecasted weather and traffic variables.  I used techniques from Causal Inference to estimate counterfactuals as I'll explain below.  

Another useful technique I'll explain is [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](/MCMC/) (MCMC) sampling.  I've used MCMC to develop radiation detection algorithms with a network of wireless radiation sensors .

Here's some [Linear Regression](/linreg/)

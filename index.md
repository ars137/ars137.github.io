I'll present some Machine Learning (ML) and statistical inference ideas I've found useful in my work.  My most recent project is to build and implement a machine learning based Causal Inference model that can aid air traffic managers to make better decisions given large datasets of observed and forecasted weather and traffic variables.  I used techniques from Causal Inference to estimate counterfactuals as I'll explain below.  

Another useful technique I'll explain is [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](/MCMC/) (MCMC) sampling.  I've used MCMC to develop radiation detection algorithms with a network of wireless radiation sensors .

Finally, here are some notes on [Linear Regression](/linreg/):
* OLS solution via QR and SVD
* Regularization (L2/Ridge and L1/Lasso)
* Diagnostics

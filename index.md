I'll present some statistical inference ideas that I've found useful in my work.  My most recent project is to build and implement models that can aid air traffic managers to make better decisions inspite of weather and traffic forecast uncertainties.  I used techniques from Causal Inference to estimate counterfactuals as I'll explain below.  

Another useful technique I'll explain is Markov Chain Monte Carlo ([MCMC])(/MCMC/) sampling.  I've used MCMC to develop radiation detection algorithms with a network of wireless radiation sensors .
